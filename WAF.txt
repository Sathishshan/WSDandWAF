-------

Configuring ModSecurity:
------------------------

ModSecurity engine needs rules to work. The rules decide how communication is handled on the web server. Depending on the configuration, ModSecurity can pass, drop, redirect, execute a script or even display a status code during a session.  

There is a default configuration file /etc/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf-recommended which you should copy to /etc/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf to enable and configure ModSecurity. To do this, run the command below:  

cp /etc/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf-recommended /etc/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf

nano /etc/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf

-> Change the value of SecRuleEngine from "DetectionOnly" to "On"

$SecRuleEngine = on

-> Restart apache2

systemctl restart apache2

Modsec - LOGFILE:
-----------------

A new log file for ModSecurity will be created in the Apache logs directory at /var/log/apache2/modsec_audit.log  

-> ModSecurity has default rules set located at /usr/share/modsecurity-crs directory. However, it is always recommended to download the rules set from GitHub:  

-> Before, you do this, rename the default rules directory  

mv /usr/share/modsecurity-crs /usr/share/modsecurity-crs.bk

git clone https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs.git /usr/share/modsecurity-crs

-> Copy the sample configuration file from the downloaded rules using the command below:

cp /usr/share/modsecurity-crs/crs-setup.conf.example /usr/share/modsecurity-crs/crs-setup.conf

-> To get these rules working on Apache, you should edit the /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/security2.conf file using a nano editor

nano /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/security2.conf

Add the following two lines at the end

IncludeOptional "/usr/share/modsecurity-crs/*.conf"
IncludeOptional "/usr/share/modsecurity-crs/rules/*.conf"
IncludeOptional "/etc/modsecurity/*.conf"

-> Restart Apache

systemctl restart apache2


Testing ModSecurity:
--------------------
