Whitelist IP Address with ModSecurity:
--------------------------------------

If your business has a website, you may be familiar with the mod_security module for Apache Web servers. ModSecurity is a firewall module for Apache servers that blocks malicious programs, scripts and injections, helping to keep your website more secure. Occasionally, you might need to bypass the module filters to accommodate a testing environment or to allow access for a particular IP address, such as for a developer working at home. Whitelisting is a straightforward task that you can accomplish with a simple text editor.
Whitelist REMOTE_ADDR

Browse to your “modsecurity.conf” file and add one on below rules. Note that this method only works on servers where you have access root permission to the core server files.

-> Create a ipwhitelist.conf in /usr/share/modsecurity-crs/ and add the following rules as you wish & restart the apache2 server...

Note: Make sure the directory "/usr/share/modsecurity-crs/" is included in apache mod configuration.
nano /etc/apache2/mods-available/security2.conf

Contains syntax

SecRule REMOTE_ADDR "@contains 127.0.0.1" "id:1,phase:1,nolog,allow,ctl:ruleEngine=Off"

Regular expression syntax

SecRule REMOTE_ADDR "^127\.xxx\.xxx\.1$" "id:1,phase:1,nolog,allow,ctl:ruleEngine=Off"

With the above rule in place, no mod_security rules will be checked for your IP address.

If you are under a load Balancer use:

SecRule REQUEST_HEADERS:X-Forwarded-For "@Contains 127.0.0.1" phase:1,nolog,allow,pass,ctl:ruleEngine=off,id:1

Whitelist network with ipMatch

SecRule REMOTE_ADDR "@ipMatch 127.0.0.0/16" "id:1,phase:1,nolog,allow,ctl:ruleEngine=Off"

What is my IP-Address ?

Make sure to replace the IP address numbers (127.0.0.1) with your own IP address. You can enter “what is my IP” on Google if you’re unsure
